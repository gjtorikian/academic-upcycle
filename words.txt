Despite Cummings' familiarity with avant-garde styles 
(likely affected by the Calligrammes of French poet Apollinaire, according to a contemporary observation), 
much of his work is quite traditional. 
Many of his poems are sonnets, albeit often with a modern twist. 
He occasionally used the blues form and acrostics. 
Cummings' poetry often deals with themes of love and nature, as well as the relationship of the individual to the masses and to the world. 
His poems are also often rife with satire.

While his poetic forms and themes share an affinity with the Romantic tradition, 
Cummings' work universally shows a particular idiosyncrasy of syntax, or way of arranging individual words into larger phrases and sentences. 
Many of his most striking poems do not involve any typographical or punctuation innovations at all, 
but purely syntactic ones.

As well as being influenced by notable modernists,
including Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound, 
Cummings in his early work drew upon the imagist experiments of Amy Lowell. 
Later, his visits to Paris exposed him to Dada and Surrealism, which he reflected in his work. 
He began to rely on symbolism and allegory, where he once had used simile and metaphor. 
In his later work, he rarely used comparisons that required objects that were not previously mentioned in the poem, choosing to use a symbol instead. 
Due to this, his later poetry is "frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier." 
Cummings also liked to incorporate imagery of nature and death into much of his poetry.

While some of his poetry is free verse (with no concern for rhyme or meter)
with an intricate rhyme scheme. 
A number of his poems feature a typographically exuberant style, 
with words, parts of words, or punctuation symbols scattered across the page,
often making little sense until read aloud, at which point the meaning and emotion become clear. 
Cummings, who was also a painter, understood the importance of presentation, and 
used typography to "paint a picture" with some of his poems.

The seeds of Cummings' unconventional style appear well established even in his earliest work. 
At age six, he wrote to his father:

Some of Cummings' most famous poems do not involve much, 
odd typography or punctuation, 
but still carry his unmistakable style,
particularly in unusual and impressionistic word order.

Cummings' work often does not proceed in accordance with the conventional combinatorial rules 
that generate typical English sentences
In addition, a number of Cummings' poems feature, 
in part or in whole, intentional misspellings, and several incorporate phonetic spellings
intended to represent particular dialects. 
Cummings also made use of inventive formations of compound words
This poem is part of a sequence of poems titled Chansons Innocentes; 
it has many references comparing the "balloonman" to Pan,
the mythical creature that is half-goat and half-man. 

Many of Cummings' poems are satirical and address social issues
but have an equal or even stronger bias toward romanticism: 
time and again his poems celebrate love, sex, and the season of rebirth.
